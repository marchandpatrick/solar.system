### Diagnose code coverage update problems (using travis)

If your code coverage badge is not updated you should check the travis log first:

1. Check that the travis build was successful

The badge must look like this: ![](build_passing.png)


2. Open the travis build log

Click on the travis build badge (picture) to open the build log.

At the end you can see code coverage section:

![](Rscript_covr.png)

</br>

3. Open the log details of the code coverage

Click on the small triangle at the left side of "$ Rscript..." to see all log details:

![](Rscript_covr_success.png)

</br>

If you do **not** see

```R
$uploaded
[1] TRUE
```

there was a problem and you will see the error message here.

If the error message is from the `covr` package you can try to find the problem by calling `covr`
on your local computer when the package source code is in the current directory with this R command:

```R
covr::package_coverage(type = "tests")
```
